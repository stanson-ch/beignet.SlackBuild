Beignet contains the code to run OpenCL programs on Intel GPUs, which defines
and implements host functions required to initialize the device, create the
command queues, the kernels, and the programs and run them on the GPU. It also
contains the compiler part of the stack.

Optional dependency is ocl-icd, if no OpenCL ICD Provider is already installed
on the system. Note that you need at least one ICD Provider installed to make
any use of OpenCL runtimes.

NOTE: normally, the package is built with Intel's provided OpenCL headers. If
you don't want to install them, set the INCLUDE_HEADERS environment variable
to 0 prior the build:

  INCLUDE_HEADERS=0 ./beignet.SlackBuild

Stanson <me@stanson.link> :
Since Beignet was abandoned by Intel, it does not follow LLVM releases, so
I decided to just add LLVM/Clang 3.9 static libraries building to 
beignet.SlackBuild. Then, beignet linked to necessary libraries statically
and will work regardless of currently installed LLVM version.
